This is the description for the program.

Created a class hierarchy for base class Shape and derived classes Triangle, Rectangle, Circle, Square, and General Shape.

Demonstrated concepts of abstraction, overriding, polymorphism and static field.
Used methods such as 'calculateArea()', 'calculatePerimeter()' as needed for demonstrating concepts.

Can input a general function (like x^2 + y^2 = 1)
as a lambda expression and use numerical methods
to calculate the area and perimeter. Can increase the accuracy by adding stepNums.

Gave some examples of the usage in the Main.

The output will be like:

The area of the circle is:12.566370614359172

The perimeter of the circle is:12.566370614359172

The area of the triangle is:6.0

The perimeter of the triangle is:12.0

The area of the rectangle is:12.0

The perimeter of the rectangle is:14.0

The area of the rectangle is:25.0

The perimeter of the rectangle is:20.0

The calculated area of the shape is:7.6524400000533515

The perimeter of the function is:4.561160973029911

The color of all shapes is:Pink
